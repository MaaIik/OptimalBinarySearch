## OptimalBinarySearch
## Applied Algorithms course (IKT301) from University 
### Divide and Qonquer Algorithm: *OptimalBinarySearch*

In this assignment, I will use the Basic World Cities Database. 
It can be downloaded for free from https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities

## Problem:
Use  the  unique  latitude  values  of  each  city  in  Norway  only. You  need  to  construct  the 
frequencies, either by random choice or dynamically as you search.  

1. Implement an optimal binary search of the latitude city values. It should be possible to 
input the latitude, and the corresponding city, if it exists, should be printed.
